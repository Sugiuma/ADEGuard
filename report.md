## 🧠 ADEGuard: Adverse Drug Event (ADE) Detection and Severity Analysis

## 🔷 1. Project Overview

**ADEGuard** is an intelligent text analytics system designed to automatically identify **Adverse Drug Events (ADEs)** from unstructured clinical narratives and analyze their **severity**.

It integrates three core AI capabilities into one interactive Streamlit dashboard:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** – Extract ADEs and Drug mentions from text using a BioBERT model.
2. **Severity Classification** – Categorize each ADE as *Severe*, *Moderate*, or *Mild* using a Transformer-based classifier.
3. **Explainability and Clustering** – Provide transparent explanations (via SHAP) and visualize latent ADE patterns using clustering.

This hybrid approach combines **data-driven NLP** with **explainable AI** to support clinical interpretation and pharmacovigilance.

## 🔷 3. Data Input and Preprocessing
### 📤 CSV Upload

The user uploads a `.csv` file containing two columns:

* `symptom_text` – free-text clinical description (e.g., *“Patient experienced high fever after dose.”*)
* `age` – patient’s age.

### 👶 Age Grouping

A preprocessing function categorizes patients into:

* **Child** (<18)
* **Young Adult** (18–39)
* **Middle Age** (40–59)
* **Senior** (≥60)

This enables **demographic analysis** of ADE severity patterns.


## 🔷 4. ADE/Drug Named Entity Recognition (NER)
### 📘 Model
A **BioBERT Token Classification** model is used, fine-tuned on biomedical entity recognition tasks.

### ⚙️ Functionality
* Tokenizes input text using BioBERT’s tokenizer.
* Predicts token-level labels:

  * `B-ADE`, `I-ADE` for Adverse Drug Events
  * `B-DRUG`, `I-DRUG` for Drugs
  * `O` for non-entities.
* Consecutive “B/I” tokens are merged to form complete entities (e.g., *“severe rash”*).

### 💡 Visualization
Each token is color-coded:
* 🔴 **Red:** ADE tokens
* 🔵 **Blue:** Drug tokens

This provides an interpretable token-level visualization of model predictions.

## 🔷 5. Severity Classification
### 📘 Model
A **Transformer-based Sequence Classification** model (BioBERT) fine-tuned for ADE severity.

### ⚙️ Prediction
* Input: Symptom narrative text.
* Output: Probability distribution across three classes — *Mild*, *Moderate*, *Severe*.
* Highest-probability class is chosen as the predicted label.

### 📊 Output Table
| symptom_text                            | pred_label |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| “Fever and chills”                 | Moderate   |
| “Slight pain at injection site”         | Mild       |
| “Anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization” | Severe     |


## 🔷 6. Explainability using SHAP
In healthcare AI, interpretability is crucial.
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) quantifies each token’s contribution to the model’s decision.

### ⚙️ Process
1. A SHAP explainer wraps the Hugging Face pipeline.
2. For a selected text sample, SHAP computes **per-token importance values**.
3. Tokens influencing the prediction more strongly receive higher SHAP values.

### 🎨 Visualization
* Tokens are highlighted in shades of red proportional to their importance.
* A bar chart displays top influential words.


### 📈 Output
* **Heatmap:** Redder tokens = stronger contribution to "Severe".
* **Bar Chart:** Word importance ranking for transparency.

## 🔷 7. Clustering and Pattern Discovery (Hybrid Analysis)
### 🧮 Embedding Model
A **SentenceTransformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** converts extracted entity text (ADE + DRUG) into dense embeddings.

### ⚙️ Clustering
* K-Means groups similar ADE/Drug embeddings.
* t-SNE reduces dimensions for visualization.
* Clusters are visualized using Plotly.

### 🎨 Color Coding
* Color = Severity (High / Medium / Low)
* Hover Info = Entity details + Age group

### 🧠 Clinical Insight
Doctors can observe clusters such as:

* **Elderly + Severe Reactions** grouped together.
* **Mild ADEs** forming a distinct region.

This helps identify population-specific ADE trends.
